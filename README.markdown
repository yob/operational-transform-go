# sharego

An experimental port of sharejs to golang. Not recommended for the real world.

Implements the server half of an operational transform session, allowing multiple
users to collaborate on a document in real time.

At this stage there's no network support, that's to come. The intention is to
offer REST and browserchannel interfaces.
